# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Android Development Task

Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository documents Task 1 of the internship, which focuses on building a basic calculator app for Android.

## Task Overview

The objective of this task is to develop a calculator app for Android that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Steps

1. **Setup Project**: Create a new Android project in Android Studio.
2. **Design UI**: Implement the user interface for the calculator. This should include:
   - Buttons for digits (0-9)
   - Buttons for arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
   - A display area to show the results
3. **Implement Logic**: Write the logic to handle button clicks and perform the arithmetic operations.
4. **Write Tests**: Develop instrumented tests to verify the app’s functionality and correctness.
5. **Build & Run**: Compile the app and test it on an Android device or emulator to ensure it operates as expected.

## Knowledge Gained

- **Android Application Development**: Gained practical experience in building and managing an Android app project.
- **User Interface (UI) Design**: Learned how to design and implement an intuitive and functional user interface for mobile applications.
- **Handling Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Acquired skills in coding to handle and process arithmetic operations based on user inputs.
- **Testing in Android**: Developed skills in creating and running instrumented tests to ensure that the app functions correctly.

## Summary

This task involved the development of a basic calculator app for Android, including:
- Setting up the project and configuring the development environment.
- Designing the user interface with necessary components such as buttons and display areas.
- Implementing the logic required for performing arithmetic calculations.
- Writing and executing tests to validate the app’s functionality.

The provided instrumented test ensures that the app’s context is correctly configured and verifies the package name.

## Conclusion

The task successfully demonstrated the fundamental steps required to build a basic calculator app for Android. It covered:
- Effective UI design and implementation
- Development of core arithmetic functionalities
